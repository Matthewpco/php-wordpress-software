A developer can use the add_action function in their theme’s functions.php file to add their own sections. Here’s an example:

function my_custom_section() {
    // Your code here
}
add_action('poh_di_lpp_after_second_section', 'my_custom_section');

In this example, my_custom_section is a function that outputs the custom section’s HTML. This section would be inserted after the second section.

This setup provides a lot of flexibility for developers to customize the landing page to their liking. They can add, remove, or reorder sections as needed.
